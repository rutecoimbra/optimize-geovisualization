PROCESSING XRD DATA TO GENERATE 3D BLOCKS:


1- CREATE FOLDER "Test" ON DESKTOP CONTAINING XRD RESULTS (EXCEL OR CSV FILES);

---------------------------------

2- COMBINE MULTIPLE EXCEL FILES INTO ONE SINGLE EXCEL FILE WITH MULTIPLE SHEETS (CODE A1)

ALTERNATIVELY, IF THE ORIGINAL FILES ARE CSV FILES: transform *csv files directly into Excel worksheets (CODEA2)

3- TAB NAMES FOR SAMPLES 1 to 10, ADD SYMBOL (#) TO SAMPLE NUMBERS:

P1-> P#1
P2-> P#2
...
P10 and following: no change is necessary

This step ensures that the samples can be ordered correctly along the final file (alphanumerically).

-----------------------------------------------

4- ORDER WORKSHEETS ASCENDENT/DESCENDENT (Code B)

in https://superuser.com/questions/1022575/need-a-macro-that-can-reorder-sheets-in-an-excel-spreadsheet

Sub Sort_Active_Book()

'
' Prompt the user as which direction they wish to
' sort the worksheets.
'

     & "Clicking No will sort in Descending Order", _
     vbYesNoCancel + vbQuestion + vbDefaultButton1, "Sort Worksheets")
   For i = 1 To Sheets.Count
      For j = 1 To Sheets.Count - 1
'
' If the answer is Yes, then sort in ascending order.
'
         If iAnswer = vbYes Then
            If UCase$(Sheets(j).Name) > UCase$(Sheets(j + 1).Name) Then

5- DELETE HEADERS (LINES 1 TO 27) IN ALL SHEETS (CODE C)

in https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/3641-excel-delete-rows-across-multiple-sheets.html

Sub bleh()
    Dim xWs As Worksheet
    Set xWs = ActiveSheet
    ThisWorkbook.Worksheets.Select
    Rows("1:27").Select
    Selection.Delete
    xWs.Select
End Sub


------------------------------------------------
6- COMBINE ALL SHEETS INTO ONE (CODE D)


in https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/1184-excel-merge-multiple-worksheets-into-one.html

Sub Combine()
Dim J As Integer
On Error Resume Next
Sheets(1).Select
Worksheets.Add
Sheets(1).Name = "Combined"
Sheets(2).Activate
Range("A1").EntireRow.Select
Selection.Copy Destination:=Sheets(1).Range("A1")
For J = 2 To Sheets.Count
Sheets(J).Activate
Range("A1").Select
Selection.CurrentRegion.Select
Selection.Offset(1, 0).Resize(Selection.Rows.Count - 1).Select
Selection.Copy Destination:=Sheets(1).Range("A200000").End(xlUp)(2)
Next
End Sub

-----------------------------------------------
7- ADD THIRD COLUMN WITH Z COORDINATE (STRATIGRAHIC POSITION or other)
